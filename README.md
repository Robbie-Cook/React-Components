# React Components

A collection of reusable UI components for React: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@robbie-cook/react-components

These components are used throughout some personal projects. 

Pull requests / contributions welcome. Please send me an email to robbie@robbie.pw. 

## Usage

### Setup

### Prerequisites / Peer dependencies

* Node (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com)
* React (https://reactjs.org/)
* styled-components (https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
* react-responsive-carousel (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel)

### Installation

Firstly, install the package (you will need to install yarn first -- (`npm install -g yarn`)): 
`yarn add @robbie-cook/react-components --save`
  
Then import the components you need. For example,

`import { Button } from @robbie-cook/react-components`

## Notes 

This project is in its very early stages, but it is massively necessary for me. I want to maximise reuse and minimise rewriting of components across projects, while having highly 'theme-able' components. 

### Roadmap

* Improvements to transition element & navbar 
* Gradual ThemeProvider implementation as needed across components (major version change will be needed)
* Very gradual move to Typescript
