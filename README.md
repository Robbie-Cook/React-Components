# React Components

A collection of reusable UI components: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@robbie-cook/react-components

These components are used throughout some personal projects. 

Pull requests / contributions welcome. Please send me an email to robbie@robbie.pw. 

## Usage

### Setup

Firstly, clone the repository: 
`git clone https://github.com/Robbie-Cook/react-components.git`
  
Then run 
`cd react-components`

Then go 
`yarn` and then `yarn start`.

### Storybook / Testing

The steps will run automatically, but you can go to the `test/` directory (e.g. `cd test`) and run `yarn start`

## Notes 

This project is in its very early stages, but it is massively necessary for me. I want to maximise reuse and minimise rewriting of components across projects, while having highly 'theme-able' components. 

### Roadmap

* Improvements to transition element & navbar 
* Gradual ThemeProvider implementation as needed across components (major version change will be needed)
* Very gradual move to Typescript
